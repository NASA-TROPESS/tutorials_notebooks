    "# Bullk Download of Megacities Data by Species\n",

    "### **Summary:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook contains Python code to query and extract metadata and data [**TROPESS CrIS SNPP Megacities** data products](https://daac.gsfc.nasa.gov/datasets?page=3&project=TROPESS&keywords=megacity) from the NASA Earthdata CMR API using the [**earthaccess Python library**](https://github.com/nsidc/earthaccess) for a user-defined date/time range and species type (gas and/or atmospheric parameters) as publicly hosted and managed by **GES DISC**. This notebook utilizes the [**Los Angeles Megacity** Standard Product](https://daac.gsfc.nasa.gov/datasets/TRPSDL2ALLCRSMGLOS_1/summary) for data files from 1 January 2020 to 31 Decemember 2020, which is queried using the DOI (Digital Object Identifier; see cell #5 below). While the notebook can be adjusted for a user-defined start/end date/time and gas species (see cell #6 below), it is intialized using the NH3 (Ammonia) gas species. \n",
    "\n",
    "A .netrc file containing an individual user's **NASA Earthdata Login** credentials (not supplied with this notebook) can either be supplied by the user up-front (in the user's home directory) or created on-demand with an embedded prompt inside this notebook. If preferred to do so manually, below are the steps to creating a .netrc file:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Create an **Earthdata Login Account** ([clear here for details](https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/users/new)).\n",
    "  2. Approve access to the **NASA GES DISC Archive** in your Earthdata Login Profile ([click here for details](https://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/earthdata-login)).\n",
    "  3. Create/modify a **.netrc** file in your home directory containing your **Earthdata Login** credentials as shown below:\n",
    "     <br>`machine urs.earthdata.nasa.gov login <your username> password <your password>`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Other important notes:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. This code was designed and tested **\"as-is\"** to run in a generic Jupyter Lab/Hub environment.\n",
    "  2. Please **\"trust\"** this notebook before executing; this will prevent errors when writing output to your local directory.\n",
    "  3. Please create a **\"data\"** directory in your local path to store data that is downloaded by this notebook.\n",
    "  4. For ease of managing your computing environment dependencies, an [**environment.yml** file](https://github.com/NASA-TROPESS/tutorials_notebooks/blob/main/environment.yml) is available. \n",
