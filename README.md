# TROPESS Tutorials & Notebooks

This repo intends to provide a combination of snippet-based tutorials referencing open-source utilities as well as full functioning Jupyter notebooks. 

Tutorials are a work in progress, and will range from any of the following features/capabilities:
1. Data search/discovery
2. Data access/subset/extraction
3. Data plotting/analysis/visualization

| Tutorial Title    | Summary        | Link        | Features/Capabilities |
|-------------------|----------------|-------------|-----------------------|
| Bulk Data Subscriber and Download Service | Demonstrates the utilization of a commandline-based tool known as the podaac-data-subscriber[downloader] which allows users to either subscribe to datasets (for periodic, continuous updating featuring the latest available data) or one-time "bulk" downloading of one or more data files with a single request. | [Tutorial](https://github.com/NASA-TROPESS/tutorials_notebooks/blob/main/data_subscriber_downloader.md) | Data search/access/extraction |
