# TROPESS Tutorials & Notebooks

This repo intends to provide a combination of snippet-based tutorials referencing open-source utilities as well as full functioning Jupyter notebooks. 

Tutorials are a work in progress, and will range from any of the following features/capabilities:
1. Data search/discovery
2. Data access/subset/extraction
3. Data plotting/analysis/visualization
4. Direct S3 (Cloud) Access
